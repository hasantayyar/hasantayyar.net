Planning to read the 2 books. One from early days of [James Lovelock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovelock). A bit optimistic or not dark the new one is totally opposite. Between two there were 2 other books related to this topic.

- _Gaia, a new look at life on earth_
- _The Vanishing Face of Gaia: A Final Warning: Enjoy It While You Can_
