This post is a reminder to myself to keep the balance of optimism/pessimism.

This post is a reminder to myself to keep the balance of optimism/pessimism.

Being an optimist was something that some people aspired to be. Usually it is regarded as a “good” quality to possess. Optimists believe things will turn out well despite setbacks, benefiting connections and resilience. However, it can lead to high expectations and poor actions, potentially harming oneself and others. Striking a balance between hope and facing challenges is crucial.

Optimism promotes resilience during difficult times. Optimistic people are better able to cope with stress and recover from setbacks than those with a pessimistic view (Seligman, 1991). Positive thinking has also been linked to improved physical health, such as improved immune function and lower rates of cardiovascular disease (Segerstrom & Sephton, 2010).

So yeah, I can say I am at least more resilient to difficult situations. But there are some important drawbacks. I may have unrealistic **expectations** about the future, and take **unnecessary risks** or make **poor decisions**. Remembering this will allow to accept my personality and avoid harm.
