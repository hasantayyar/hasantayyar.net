This post is a reminder to myself to keep the balance of optimism/pessimism.

Being an optimist was something that some people aspired to be.
Usually it is regarded as a "good" quality to possess. Optimists believe things will turn out well despite setbacks, benefiting connections and resilience. However, it can lead to high expectations and poor actions, potentially harming oneself and others. Striking a balance between hope and facing challenges is crucial.

Being an optimist has a lot of potential benefits for me for sure.
It promotes resilience amid challenges during diffucult times.
People with a positive view of the world are better able to cope with stress and recover 
from setbacks than those with a pessimistic view (Seligman, 1991). Positive thinking has also been 
linked to improved physical health outcomes, such as improved immune function and lower rates of 
cardiovascular disease (Segerstrom & Sephton, 2010). 

So yeah I can say I am at least more resillient to 
diffucult situations. But there are some important drawbacks. I may have unrealistic **expectations** about the future, 
and take **unnecessary risks** or make **poor decisions**. Remembering this will allow to accept my personality and avoid harm.
